INTRODUCTION
------------

**BaculaFS** is a tool, independent of Bacula, that represents the
Bacula catalog and backup storage media as a read-only filesystem in
userspace.

**BaculaFS** is specifically designed to cater for the following
use-cases:

- maintaining a remote snapshot of the files in the backup storage
  using `rsync`_ or `duplicity`_
- auditing the contents of backup jobs, without resorting to SQL
  queries
- comparing backup jobs (using several mount points)

Note that **BaculaFS** is a maintenance tool - its operation may
interfere with the normal operation of a live Bacula setup (see the
LIMITATIONS_ section below).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

**BaculaFS** has been tested with the following set of required
software packages:

+ Bacula 5.0.1 with one of the following database backends:

  * SQLite_ 3.6.23.1
  * MySQL_ 5.1.47
  * PostgreSQL_ 8.4.4
  
+ FUSE_ components:

  * Python FUSE 0.2.1
  * FUSE library 2.8.1
  * fusermount 2.8.1
  * FUSE kernel interface 7.12

+ Python_ 2.6.5, with the following additional libraries:

  * MySQLdb_ 1.2.2
  * psycopg2_ 2.0.14
  * pexpect_ 2.3
  
+ attr_ extended attributes utilities 2.4.44

**BaculaFS** requires the following in order to function:

+ access to the database that's used to store the Bacula catalog
+ access to the Bacula storage device
+ access to the Bacula ``bextract`` utility (bundled with the Bacula
  storage daemon installation)

OPERATION
---------

INITIALIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BaculaFS** starts by running several SQL queries against the Bacula
catalog. This is done to determine the list of files that belong to
the most recent backup for a given client and fileset.

**BaculaFS** can also be told to represent a backup snapshot
corresponding to a specified date and time, or a list of backup job
ids.

Following this, **BaculaFS** may run ``bextract`` *once* to prefetch
and cache symbolic links and actual file contents, depending on user
specified command line options.

At this point the filesystem is ready.

CACHE
~~~~~

Opening a file for reading causes **BaculaFS** to run ``bextract`` in
order to extract the file from the storage device. If this operation
succeeds, the file is cached for subsequent read operations.

Bacula storage is not designed for random access file retrieval, so it
is important to select a suitable cache prefetch strategy beforehand.
Running ``bextract`` once, during filesystem initialization, to
extract several files, is much more efficient than running it several
times to extract each individual file, when accessed at a later stage.

For example:

- use ``-o prefetch_attrs`` for storage space usage analysis
  (e.g. with Baobab_)
- use ``-o prefetch_symlinks`` for any manual filesystem traversal
  with command line or GUI tools (``find``, ``mc``, etc.)
- use ``-o prefetch_diff`` with ``rsync``

.. _Baobab: http://www.marzocca.net/linux/baobab/

The cache may be cleaned up automatically upon un-mounting the
filesystem, with ``-o cleanup``. It may also be reused between mount
operations with ``-o user_cache_path``.

EXTENDED ATTRIBUTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BaculaFS** uses extended file attributes to expose Bacula specific
information for each file in the filesystem. These extended attributes
are all grouped in the ``user.baculafs`` namespace:

::

   user.baculafs.FileIndex
   user.baculafs.JobId
   user.baculafs.LStat
   user.baculafs.MD5

The root directory has several more attributes, that expose filesystem
instance-specific information:

::

   user.baculafs.cache_prefix
   user.baculafs.client
   user.baculafs.datetime
   user.baculafs.fileset
   user.baculafs.joblist

and several more attributes for monitoring the file extraction
process:
 
::

   user.baculafs.bextract.failures
   user.baculafs.bextract.path
   user.baculafs.bextract.pending
   user.baculafs.bextract.retries
   user.baculafs.bextract.state
   user.baculafs.bextract.volume

MISSING VOLUMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the storage device is a tape drive then it's possible that
**BaculaFS** will attempt to retrieve a file from a volume that's on
an unmounted tape. **BaculaFS** will then set
``user.baculafs.bextract.state`` to ``*user intervention required*``,
and will wait for user intervention.

The user should then mount the tape containing the missing volume and
set the state to ``run``, to make **BaculaFS** retry the operation:

::

   attr -s baculafs.bextract.state -V run <mount-point>

Please note that this feature has undergone only rudimentary
testing. Expect breakage.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

COMMON PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BaculaFS** will abort if no backup job was run for the
client/fileset combination selected by the user.

**BaculaFS** will abort if the target mount point is in use. Note,
however, that mount point availability is checked by FUSE only *after*
the (potentially lengthy) initialization of **BaculaFS**.

Browsing a **BaculaFS** mount point with a file manager like Nautilus_
is liable to be very slow. This is because the file manager reads data
from each file being listed, in order to determine its type, generate
a thumbnail etc. This, in turn, triggers **BaculaFS** to extract the
files, one at a time, from the Bacula storage device to its cache
directory. 

.. _Nautilus: http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus

LOCKING
~~~~~~~

Access to the storage device by different instances of **BaculaFS** is
serialized by locking the storage daemon configuration file. This
means that you can mount several views of the backup catalog
(e.g. accessing backup snapshots of different clients or snapshots
from the same client but from different dates).

There are at least two issues with this locking mechanism that you
should note:

- the lock is *advisory*, meaning that it does not prevent the Bacula
  storage daemon itself from accessing the storage device while in use
  by **BaculaFS**
- depending on your setup, the lock may not work if the storage daemon
  configuration file is accessed via NFS


UNSUPPORTED FEATURES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**BaculaFS** depends on ``bextract`` and thus inherits its
limitations: 

- **BaculaFS** can be used with Windows filesets, but it does not
  reproduce any Windows specific file attributes
- Encrypted backup files are not supported
